There are multiple ways to implement the Observer Pattern in iOS:

1️⃣ Using NotificationCenter
A lightweight and decentralized approach where objects subscribe to notifications.

2️⃣ Using KVO (Key-Value Observing)
KVO is useful when observing property changes in another object.

3️⃣ Using Combine (Modern Approach)

4️⃣ Using Delegation (Manual Observer Pattern)

3️⃣ Using RxSwift

Which One to Use?
NotificationCenter → When multiple objects need to listen (Global Events).
KVO → When tracking property changes.
Combine → When using a reactive programming approach.
Delegation → When having a one-to-one relationship.


🔥 Advantages
✅ Decoupled Design → Product does not need to know how User handles notifications.
✅ Scalable → Multiple users can subscribe/unsubscribe dynamically.
✅ Follows Observer Pattern → Ensures efficient notification updates.
