The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one from scratch. This is useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

When to Use the Prototype Pattern in iOS?
✅ Good Use Cases:

When creating an object is expensive (e.g., deep copying large models).
When you need a copy of an object but don’t want to go through initialization again.
When working with objects that have different configurations but share common properties.
