The "Builder Pattern" is a creational design pattern because it helps in constructing complex objects step by step. Instead of creating objects directly using a constructor, it provides a systematic way to build them, improving readability and flexibility.

Where is the Builder Pattern Used in iOS?
SwiftUI View Builders: SwiftUI uses a declarative approach similar to the Builder Pattern.


Why Use the Builder Pattern?
Improves Readability – No need to pass many parameters in a long initializer.
Handles Optional Properties – You can add only the properties you need.
Encapsulates Object Creation Logic – Keeps initialization flexible and maintainable.
